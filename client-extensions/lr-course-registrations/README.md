# lr-course-registrations - Liferay Course Registrations React Custom Element Client Extension

When the OOTB Liferay functionality is insufficient to satisfy your requirements, a custom Javascript application can be the solution.

In this app, we leverage Liferay's React and Clay to create a small deployable application to Liferay to promote a custom solution for the Intro to Objects workshop.

Enjoy!
